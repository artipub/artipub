@artipub/cli is an artipub cli tools，convenient for users to publish and update articles through the command line

## ❓ Why is it needed @artipub/cli?

I don’t want to use @artipub/core through js. I want to publish and update articles to multiple platforms in a more lightweight and flexible way. After writing an article, I want to publish the article markdown to multiple platforms immediately. At this time, @artipub/cli is derived to solve this problem.
